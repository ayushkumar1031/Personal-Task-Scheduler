# Personal-Task-Scheduler
The Personal Task Scheduler is a simple Python program that helps you manage your daily tasks. You can add, view, and delete tasks easily, and optionally get desktop notifications when tasks are due. This project demonstrates Python programming, file handling, and basic task scheduling concepts, making it beginner-friendly yet practical.

What It Does:
Stores your tasks in a JSON file (tasks.json)
Allows you to add new tasks with an optional due date
Displays all tasks in a clear, numbered list
Lets you delete tasks by selecting the task number 
Optionally shows desktop notifications for due tasks (requires plyer library)

Features:
Simple and easy-to-use CLI interface
Persistent storage of tasks using JSON
Optional task reminders
Beginner-friendly project to demonstrate Python skills

How It Works:
The program runs in a command-line menu. Each option lets you perform a specific task management operation:
Add Task – Input a task name and optional due date
View Tasks – See all your current tasks and their due dates
Delete Task – Remove a task from the list by entering its number
Exit – Quit the program
All tasks are saved in tasks.json, so they persist even after closing the program. If desktop notifications are supported, the program will notify you when a task is due.

My Learnings:
Learned file handling and JSON storage in Python
Practiced building a simple CLI application
Learned about task scheduling and reminders
Improved problem-solving and debugging skills
